Typically, mutual aid provides personnel or resources to affected communities in the immediate aftermath of a disaster. The main goal is to accelerate community recovery and reduce future risks. While mutual aid resources are often provided without charge, it's worth noting that specific arrangements can vary depending on the agreements in place between jurisdictions.</p></div><div class="question"><h3>What is mutual aid for building departments?</h3><p>Natural disasters can often leave local building officials overwhelmed with the task of assessing structural damage and ensuring public safety. Mutual aid for building departments is a straightforward concept where skilled professionals from neighboring jurisdictions step in to assist communities with inspections, hazard mitigation, and other building department functions in the wake of a catastrophic event.</p></div><div class="question"><h3>Who responds to mutual aid for building departments?</h3><p>Typically, mutual aid can provide communities with additional building inspectors, plan reviewers, or code enforcement officers in the immediate aftermath of a disaster. These are often civil servants from neighboring communities and states. In some cases, mutual aid responders can also include private engineers, architects and other skilled professionals.</p></div><div class="question"><h3>What assistance can mutual aid provide to a building department?</h3><p>Mutual aid can provide additional building inspectors, plan reviewers, and code enforcement officers to a building department in need. These professionals can help conduct rapid damage assessments, determine building safety, and process emergency permits following a disaster. They can also assist with routine inspections and plan reviews during periods of high workload or staff shortages. This support helps the local building department maintain service levels, ensure public safety, and expedite recovery efforts.</p></div><div class="question"><h3>Does mutual aid for building departments work the same in every state?</h3><p>The details of implementation, resource sharing, and reimbursement can differ significantly from one state to another. Some states have formalized statewide mutual aid systems, while others rely more on local or regional agreements. It's important for building officials to understand their state's specific mutual aid framework and any interstate compacts that may apply. The state search tool on our <a class="usa-link" href="/10x-mutual-aid/">main page</a> can help you begin to explore your state's mutual aid system.</p></div><div class="question"><h3>Are there protections against liability?</h3><p>Many states have enacted legislation that offers some degree of liability protection for mutual aid providers lending assistance under official mutual aid agreements. This protection can vary depending on state laws and specific mutual aid agreements. The contacts provided by our search tool can help you understand the liability protections in place for your individual situation.</p></div><div class="question"><h3>Will mutual aid cost my community?</h3><p>Reimbursement between communities in the same state can vary by state, as each state, district, and territory has its own specific regulations and procedures. Typically, the requesting community (the one that received aid) is responsible for reimbursing the assisting community for eligible costs. This usually follows a "neighbor helping neighbor" principle, where the community benefiting from the assistance bears the financial responsibility. Some states have established funds or mechanisms to help cover these costs, especially in cases of larger emergencies or disasters. In such instances, the state might step in to reimburse the assisting communities directly or provide funds to the requesting community for this purpose.</p><p>Under the Emergency Mutual Aid Compact (EMAC), which facilitates interstate assistance, the requesting state is responsible for reimbursing the assisting state, but this is often eligible for federal disaster reimbursement. However, it's important to note that while the immediate deployment may not have an upfront cost, your community may need to budget for potential reimbursements or cost-sharing depending on the specific agreement and disaster declaration status. For example, the standard cost-share for FEMA Public Assistance is typically 75% federal and 25% non-federal, though this can sometimes be adjusted for catastrophic events. The requesting state would be responsible for the non-federal share, which they may pass on to the local jurisdiction that received the aid.</p></div><div class="question"><h3>Is an emergency declaration required to utilize mutual aid for building departments?</h3><p>Mutual aid for building departments can often be activated without a formal disaster declaration. Many communities have agreements in place that allow for cooperation and resource sharing for smaller-scale incidents that do not meet the threshold for a disaster declaration. However, it is important to note that the specific rules and procedures can vary depending on your local and state regulations. Some areas may have specific requirements for activating mutual aid, while others maintain flexible systems for sharing resources.</p><p>In cases of larger disasters, a formal declaration can unlock additional resources and funding streams, potentially making it easier to cover the costs of mutual aid. For interstate assistance through the Emergency Management Assistance Compact (EMAC), a governor's declaration is required. EMAC is a national interstate mutual aid agreement that enables states to share resources during large-scale disasters. Under EMAC, the governor of the affected state must declare a state of emergency and request assistance before other states can send aid. This process ensures a coordinated response and helps establish eligibility for federal reimbursement.</p></div><div class="question"><h3>What costs are eligible for reimbursement?</h3><p>When it comes to reimbursement under IMAC (Intrastate Mutual Aid Compact) and EMAC (Emergency Management Assistance Compact), eligible costs can vary depending on the specific state agreements and the nature of the emergency. Generally, reimbursable expenses often include personnel costs (such as salaries, overtime, and benefits), travel expenses, equipment usage, and supplies directly related to the mutual aid response. Some agreements may also cover costs for lodging, meals, and incidental expenses for deployed personnel.</p><p>To ensure proper reimbursement, it's essential for both requesting and assisting entities <span class="text-bold">to carefully document all expenses</span> and follow the specific guidelines outlined in their state's mutual aid agreements.</p></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><script>(function () {
